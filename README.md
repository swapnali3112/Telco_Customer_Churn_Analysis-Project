Python Project For Data Analysis- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) End-to-End Project
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." 

Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## 📌 Project Overview
In the telecommunications industry, the cost of acquiring a new customer is 5x higher than retaining an existing one. This project performs a deep-dive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of 7,043 customers to identify the primary drivers of attrition and provide actionable retention strategies.

## 📊 Key Results & Conclusions
* Overall Churn Rate:26.5%
* Highest Risk Segment:Fiber Optic users (41.9% churn) and Month-to-Month contract holders (42.7% churn).
* Retention Levers: Customers with Tech Support and Online Security show a retention rate of ~85%, significantly higher than the baseline.
* Payment Friction: Electronic Check users are at the highest risk (>45% churn), identifying a need for automated payment incentives.

## 🛠️ Data Analysis Workflow
1.  Data Cleaning:Handled missing values in `TotalCharges` and standardized categorical variables.
2.  Univariate Analysis: Explored distribution of tenure, monthly charges, and churn.
3.  Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis: Analyzed the impact of service types (Streaming, Security, Support) on Churn.
    Visualized churn distribution across demographic segments (Senior Citizens, Partners).
4.  Insight Generation: Translated statistical findings into business recommendations.



## 💡 Key Findings from Data
*Tenure: The first 6 months are the most critical. If a customer stays past 2 years, their churn probability drops by 70%.
* Contract Type: Long-term contracts (1-2 years) are the strongest shield against churn.
* Bundled Services:"No Internet" customers churn the least (~7%), while those with high-speed Fiber but no support churn the most.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` installed.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
